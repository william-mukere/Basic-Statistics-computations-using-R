# Basic-Statistics-computations-using-R
Inserting data manually into R gui and finding their means and variance
using the code provided we insert code into R using c() function.

For example for the first line we say y <- c(272,......,137)
After running the code the output for sum(y) = 6622
Then we can get the variance using the code var(y)
The variance will be 47058.69

Repeat above steps for the rest of the data variables provided.
